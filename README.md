# European_Soccer_Prediction
The aim is to use and compare prediction methods to predict the match outcomes and perform model evaluation comparing these models with the Bookies accuracy.  With the use of data from the European Soccer Database, this model will determine the outcome of a match (win, lose, draw).

    <h1>Predicting Soccer Match Outcomes Using FIFA Statistics and Engineered Features</h1>
    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <p>Utilized FIFA statistics and engineered features to develop a predictive model for soccer match outcomes.</p>
    <p>Evaluated multiple machine learning algorithms to determine the best-performing model.</p>
    <h2>Model Performance:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Logistic Regression Model:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Achieved the highest accuracy score on the test match dataset.</li>
                <li>Demonstrated strong predictive capabilities for soccer match outcomes.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Random Forest Model:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Ranked as the second-best performing model in terms of accuracy.</li>
                <li>Showed promise in predicting soccer match results.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Performed well in predicting soccer match outcomes, though not as accurate as Logistic Regression and Random Forest.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Challenges with Linear Regression:</h2>
    <p>Linear Regression was found to be ineffective for our dataset.</p>
    <p>Limited variability in the dependent variable made it unsuitable for predicting soccer match outcomes accurately.</p>
    <h2>Model Comparison:</h2>
    <p>Compared the accuracy of our predictive models to bookies' predictions.</p>
    <p>Our model outperformed bookies' predictions by 47.76 basis points, indicating its superior predictive power.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    <p>Our approach, which combines FIFA statistics and engineered features, provides a robust framework for predicting soccer match outcomes.</p>
    <p>Logistic Regression emerged as the top-performing model for this task.</p>
    <p>The predictive accuracy of our models surpasses that of bookmakers, indicating their potential value in soccer match outcome prediction.</p>
